## Count-based two-step clustering on simulation datasets

The same Seurat pipeline was used. The setting of beta was changed back to the original.

```{r, echo=F}
beta.seurat <- read.table("data/Beta_Seurat.txt")
rownames(beta.seurat) <- c(paste0("guide", 1:6), "offset")
colnames(beta.seurat) <- paste0("factor", 1:10)
knitr::kable(beta.seurat)
```

Under this setting, the first two guides have weak correlation with the first two factors that are difficult to detect.

Therefore, although clusters has strong (often negative) correlation with the factors, they usually have weak associations with the guide. Still, it is a little visible.

I use the p values of Correlation T-test and Chi-Square test to identify associations between clusters and guides. Use Seurat findmarkers() to identify the DEGs for the associated clusters. This procedure has been performed over 300 simulation datasets.

Compare the FPR and FNR of GSFA and Seurat clustering on guides with $\beta > 0.2$.

## Normal-based clustering on simulation datasets
For Normal data, I used kmeans to find clusters of cells. Kmeans does not have a clean one-to-one correspondence like Seurat.
